•	Trigger: When the user clicks the "Search" button.
Process:
o	Retrieve the input data and the target number to search for.
o	Convert the input string into a sorted list of integers.
o	Apply the search algorithm (e.g., Binary Search).
o	Display the result using a message box indicating whether the number was found and its index.
Step 5: Display Results
•	For Sorting: Show the sorted list in a designated area of the GUI.
•	For Searching: Use a message box to inform the user of the search result (found or not found).
Step 6: End Process
